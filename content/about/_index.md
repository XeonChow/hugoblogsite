This is a personal blog of Xeon Chow.

I am a doctoral student struggling for a Ph.D. degree. Despite I majoring in aeronautics related subject, my bigger interest is in many other irrelevant areas, like computer science (none professional at all), photography (quite amateur) and electronic devices of all kinds. Recently I am charmed by Linux and trying to learn more about it by a Raspberry pi. My other hobbies include watching movies and TV series, listening to music and wandering alone when vacant. My favorite singer is Khalil Fong cause he is not only a good singer but also talented in song writing, not to mention he masters several music instruments and various music genres, a real genius yet still works so hard. Woody Allen, Quentin Tarantino and Ang Lee are among my favorite movie directors. One movie I never feel bored to watch over and over is *Kill Bill*. Video games are surprisingly not what I like much, maybe because I fail to see the fun in most of them or I just lack the talent in playing games.

This site is intended as a place where I can say whatever I want, free of censorship on usual social platforms. I would share my thoughts about social issues and life here. In technical aspect, I'd use it to take notes of my academic research or things I am learning. Also if I watch any movies or TV series, or read any books I find interesting, I might write some review of them. I like the feeling of owning a place where I have total control, just like owning a private territory.

By the way, this site is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a very fast static site generator. Theme I choose is [MemE](https://github.com/reuixiy/hugo-theme-meme/), a modern, elegant, minimal theme yet provides tons of features and is easy to configure. Thanks a lot to Hugo and [reuixiy](https://github.com/reuixiy) who generously provides such an awesome theme.
