I just finished watching a new movie called *The Half of It* produced by Netflix, and here is a quick review of it before I forget how I feel about it.

It's not a long story among 3 high school students. Ellie Chu, a shy but smart girl, agreed to help Paul Munksy, who is not good at talking, to write a love letter to a popular girl called Aster. At first, Ellie agreed to take this job only for money, and thought she would only write one letter for Munksy. But after several letter exchange, she found that she and Aster could truly understand each other and gradually fell in love with Aster. But on the other hand, Aster didn't know it was Ellie who had been exchanging letters and texting with her. Of course, misunderstanding happened. In the end Ellie told the truth and the 3 young people showed their feelings to each other.

I like this movie, for there are quite a few points striking me. It reminds me of the old days when I still write a letter on paper. I still remember the different experience of writing a letter, especially to the girl I liked (yes, love letter might be the only hand written letter in this Internet era). Handwriting takes much more effort than texting, which means naturally you would treat it much more seriously. Just like in the movie, when writing a letter, one must carefully select the words and phrases used, try hard to earn the attention of the other. A hand written letter carries more feelings, it's more subtle and powerful.

People don't write letters now, even emails are rare these days, except those from your work or commercials. Instead, we use IM to connect each other. it's quicker and immediate, you don't need to wait too long. But gradually, we become impatient, we want a reply instantly, which in turn makes us feel upset about replying to others. And the conversations we have in IM are normally shallow, lacking the depth and scope in more formal letters. Our words are more casual in IM, emojis and memes are so popular that they can even replace all the words you use in chats.

Well, the era of letters has gone inevitably, there is no way back. But sometimes, I do miss the formalness and seriousness in traditional letters, which are capable of carrying more feelings than IM messages and make the connections of people much more firm.
